# 1. What is the real business problem?
> The core problem is Pipeline Inflation masking Revenue Inefficiency.

The CRO is suffering from a **Vanity Metric** illusion. **Healthy pipeline volume** suggests Marketing is doing its job, but the **dropping win rate** proves that the quality of leads or the sales execution has degraded.

**The Financial Impact:** The company is likely bleeding cash by paying to acquire and service leads that have no intention of buying (high Customer Acquisition Cost, low Lifetime Value).

**The Operational Impact:** Sales reps are wasting time on **zombie deals** instead of focusing on closable opportunities.

# 2. What key questions should an AI system answer for the CRO?
> To solve this, the AI needs to move from **What happened?** to **Why?** and **What now?**.

**1. Is the drop systemic, or confined to a specific region, industry, or sales team?**

**2. Are we losing because the leads are lower quality (Marketing issue), or because our reps are failing to close valid deals (Sales issue)?**

**3. Which deals currently in the 'healthy' pipeline are actually at high risk of rotting, despite looking good on paper?**

**4. What is the single most effective action a rep can take today to save a specific deal?**

# 3. What metrics matter most for diagnosing win rate issues?
> Standard **Win Rate** is a lagging indicator (it tells you you died 3 months ago). We need leading and diagnostic metrics.

**Stage-by-Stage Conversion Rate:** To identify exactly where deals fall off (e.g., do they die after the Demo? Or at Contract Negotiation?).
  
**Sales Cycle Length (Velocity):** Are deals closing, but taking 2x longer? This often precedes a win rate drop.
  
**Win Rate by Cohort (Vintage Analysis):** Comparing the win rate of leads created in Q1 vs. Q2, rather than just closed in those quarters.
  
**Deal Slippage Rate:** The percentage of deals that push their "expected close date" to the next month. High slippage = unhealthy pipeline.

# 4. What assumptions are you making about the data or business?

**Assumption 1 (Pipeline Definition):** We assume the CRO’s definition of "healthy pipeline" refers to the count or total value of open deals, without adjusting for probability.

**Assumption 2 (Time Lag):** B2B sales cycles take time (e.g., 3-6 months). A drop in win rate today likely stems from operational changes or lead source changes made months ago.

**Assumption 3 (Data Truth):** We assume the outcome field is accurate and that "Lost" deals are genuinely lost (not just forgotten/stalled in the system).

**Assumption 4 (Stable Product):** We assume there was no catastrophic product failure (like a server outage) that caused the drop; we are looking for sales/market inefficiencies.
